            <h2>The Goofy Cats In Question</h2>After living with cats for most of my life, I have decided to write a biography about me and my experiences with
		the two that I see most often. My family has a cat named Loki, and me and my roommates have a cat named Riley. They are both very cute and have very
		distinct personalities. In the pages linked in the menu you can learn more about these cats and their comedic antics.

            <h2>The History of Cats</h2><br>Cats were first domesticaed in the middle east around 10,000 years ago and spread globally. Egyptians were the first
		to treat them as pets at around 1500 B.C. and since then the rest of the world has adopted the little felines as pets themselves.
